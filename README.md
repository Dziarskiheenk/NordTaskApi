# NordTaskApi
This repository contains the Notes API - part of a NordCloud recruiting task.

To run the API, you need to create the database from EF Core migrations:
  1. Open the solution file with Visual Studio. API was created with .NET 6, so VS 2022 will be required.
  2. Restore Nuget dependencies
  3. In the Package Manager Console, insert: Update-Database
  4. Run the project
